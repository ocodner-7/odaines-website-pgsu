    <h2 id="What?"> What is scrum?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Scrum is a framework that helps teams to collaborate</li>
        <li>Scrum encourgaes teams to learn through experience and self-organisation</li>
        <li>Scrum breaks down projects/products into fragments called ‘Sprints’</li> 
        <li>People often think Scrum and Agile are the same but scrum is a framework and agile is a mindset.</li>
    </ul>

<h2 id="How?"> How does scrum work?</h2>

<p>When using the scrum framework a product is broken down into pieces  or ‘iterations’ known as ‘sprints’. This allows large complex projects to be broken down into more manageable bit-sized pieces.
Getting sprints right will help your agile team ship better software with fewer headaches. </p>

<h2 id="More">More on sprints</h2>

Sprint planning - Sprint planning is a teamwork event that is based on the principle of answering 2 vital questions; What work will we get done in this sprint?’ And ’how will said work get done?’ This must be the ceremony that kicks off any sprint
Product backlog: A product backlog is a to do list that is based on priority. It should be laid out before sprint planning begins.
-Selecting the best work items for a sprint is a shared effort between the product owner, scrum master and the development team.
-In a scrum a sprint should be a fixed amount of time and should have strict deadlines. That’s why planning sprints is very important and the sprint planning itself should also be a strict, fixed amount of time.
-During sprint planning it’s easy to become overwhelmed when deciding what task should come first, who should do it and how long it will take to complete. So it’s nest to focus on the outcome of the sprint rather than the work itself.

<div>
<h2 id="Cerem"> Ceremonies</h2>

-Ceremonies(meetings) are an important part of agile scrum development.
Examples of ceremonies that should be done in scrum development are:
Sprint planning - Planning out a successful sprint
Daily stand up - Short meeting(no more than 15 mins) everyday. Typically done in the morning, it’s purpose is to inform everyone of what is happening across the team.
Sprint review - Conducted at the end of a sprint or other milestone. It’s purpose is to showcase the work completed to the team.
Retrospective - Conducted at the end of a sprint. Purpose is to allow team to give and receive feedback about what went and what went not so well.
</div>

<h2 id="Roles"> Scrum roles</h2>

<p>There are three roles in the scrum framework: the product owner, scrum master and the development team. Each role has a clear and distinct purpose that work together and allow the scrum method to work.
Product owner: The role of the product owner is to visualise the product and have a vision of how the product should be brought to life. The product owner should have a very good understanding of customers along with business and marketing strategies and requirements. Having this understanding allows them to fulfil their responsibility of expressing the priorities of work to the development team.
Scrum master: Scrum masters act as the scrum experts in their team and have the responsibility of coaching product owners, developers and the business as a whole on the scrum process, how it works and how to refine it to gain efficiency using scrum.
Scrum development team: Scrum developers are the ones who bring the product to life and work on making the vision of the product owner become a reality. They work alongside the product owner to predict how much work they can complete per sprint. They also plan ways to improve their development strategies as they learn, to work out what approach is best for the whole development team.</p>
